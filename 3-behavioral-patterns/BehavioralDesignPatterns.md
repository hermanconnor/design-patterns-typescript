# Behavioral Design Patterns

## What are Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on how objects interact and communicate with one another. These patterns help define clear communication protocols between objects, making it easier to manage complex interactions. They enhance the flexibility of object behavior and promote better organization of responsibilities.

### Key Characteristics of Behavioral Design Patterns

1. **Communication Management**: They manage how objects interact, defining the flow of communication and responsibility.
2. **Encapsulation of Behavior**: They encapsulate algorithms or responsibilities, allowing for easier modification and reuse without affecting other components.
3. **Improved Flexibility**: They promote dynamic behavior changes at runtime, enabling systems to adapt to varying requirements.

### Common Behavioral Design Patterns

Some common behavioral design patterns include:

1. **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows multiple objects to handle a request without specifying the handler explicitly. Each handler either processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.

2. **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also supports undoable operations.

3. **Interpreter**: Defines a representation for a language's grammar and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language. Useful in situations like parsing expressions.

4. **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.

5. **Mediator**: Facilitates communication between objects, promoting loose coupling by preventing direct interactions between them.

6. **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

7. **Observer**: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

8. **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.

9. **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

10. **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

11. **Visitor**: Allows you to define new operations on a set of objects without changing their classes. It separates an algorithm from the object structure.

### Why Use Behavioral Design Patterns?

- **Enhanced Communication**: They facilitate clear communication between objects, leading to better-organized code.
- **Decoupled Components**: By separating behavior from the objects that execute it, these patterns promote a modular design, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: They allow systems to adapt and change behavior dynamically, making them more responsive to varying conditions and requirements.
