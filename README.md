## Introduction

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. This collection aims to provide developers with easy access to these patterns and demonstrate how to implement them effectively in TypeScript.

## Design Patterns Included

This repository currently includes implementations of the following design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns**

   - Singleton
   - Factory Method
   - Abstract Factory
   - Builder
   - Prototype

Each pattern is contained in its own directory with a detailed explanation and example code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hermanconnor/design-patterns-typescript.git
   ```
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd design-patterns-typescript
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To see an example of a specific design pattern, navigate to its respective folder and review the provided TypeScript files. You can run the examples using:

```bash
ts-node path/to/client.ts
```

Ensure you have [ts-node](https://typescritptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-0.html#ts-node) installed if you haven't done so.
