The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines in object-oriented programming that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. The acronym SOLID stands for five principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This makes the class easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes to allow new functionality without altering existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without introducing errors.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means creating smaller, more specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This helps reduce the coupling between different parts of a system.

Together, these principles aim to create code that is easier to manage and adapt over time.
