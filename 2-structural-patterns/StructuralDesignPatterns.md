# Structural Design Patterns

## What are Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures. They help define clear relationships between components, making it easier to understand how they interact and fit together. By using these patterns, developers can create flexible and efficient systems that promote reuse and maintainability.

### Key Characteristics of Structural Design Patterns

1. **Composition**: They allow for the composition of objects to achieve new functionality.
2. **Flexibility**: They provide ways to define how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, which can be easily modified.
3. **Simplification**: They help in simplifying complex relationships between classes and objects.

### Common Structural Design Patterns

Here are some well-known structural design patterns:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an adapter that bridges the gap.

2. **Bridge Pattern**: Separates an interface from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.

3. **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, enabling clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

4. **Decorator Pattern**: Adds new behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure, allowing for flexible enhancements.

5. **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with that subsystem.

6. **Flyweight Pattern**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects, typically used for objects with many similar instances.

7. **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, which can be useful for lazy initialization, access control, or logging.

### Why Use Structural Design Patterns?

- **Improve Code Organization**: They promote better organization of code by clarifying relationships between classes and objects.
- **Enhance Reusability**: They enable components to be reused across different contexts without requiring significant changes.
- **Encourage Separation of Concerns**: They help separate different functionalities, leading to cleaner, more manageable codebases.
